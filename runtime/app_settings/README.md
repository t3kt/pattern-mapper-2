# App Settings

App settings are application-wide settings and UI state, which are not specific to a particular project.

For example, which tab is visible in the main UI panel, how wide the sidebars are, etc.

The settings are persisted in a `pm2-settings.json` file, which is automatically updated when the settings are changed.

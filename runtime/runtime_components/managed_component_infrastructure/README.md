# Managed Component Infrastructure

These components comprise the systems that support handling collections of managed components.

Managed components are things that are constructed dynamically based on a project setup. For example, state generators
are managed components hosted inside the state generator subsystem.

Managed components have a runtime part and a UI part.

This directory should not contain any actual managed components (which have their own category-specific folders next to
this one).
